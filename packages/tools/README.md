# Kaiban Tools for AI Agents

This package provides a collection of specialized tools designed for use with AI agents, enhancing their capabilities for various tasks.

## Purpose

The Kaiban Tools package offers a set of tools that can be integrated into AI agent systems, allowing agents to perform a wide range of tasks more effectively. These tools are designed to extend the capabilities of AI agents, enabling them to interact with external services, process data, and perform complex operations.

## Features

- A collection of tools specifically designed for AI agents
- Easy integration with existing agent frameworks and architectures
- Tools for various purposes, including web scraping, data transformation, and more
- Configurable options for each tool to suit different agent requirements

## Installation

```bash
npm install @kaibanjs/tools
```

## Available Tools

### 1. Firecrawl

Firecrawl is a tool that allows agents to interact with the Firecrawl web scraping service, enabling them to extract clean, structured data from websites.

### 7. Simple RAG

The Simple RAG Tool integrates with various components from the langchain library to provide a simple interface for asking questions and retrieving answers using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. By default use MemoryVectorStore for storing vectors, OpenAIEmbeddings for embeddings, and OpenAI LLM for generating answers.

### Features

- Integrates with the RAG Toolkit for handling the RAG process
- Uses a Loader instance to load and process documents
- Utilizes a Chunker instance to chunk and process text
- Employs an Embeddings instance for handling embeddings
- Stores vectors using a VectorStore instance
- Leverages an LLM instance for the language model
- Defines a promptQuestionTemplate for asking questions
- Requires an OpenAI API key for interacting with the OpenAI API

### Usage

```js
const tool = new SimpleRAG({
  OPENAI_API_KEY: 'your-openai-api-key',
  content: 'Large content to process',
});
const result = await tool._call({ query: 'question to ask' });
```

or

```js
const tool = new SimpleRAG({
  OPENAI_API_KEY: 'your-openai-api-key',
});
const result = await tool._call({
  content: 'large content to process',
  query: 'question to ask',
});
```

## Development

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaiban-ai/KaibanJS.git
```

2. Navigate to the tools package:

```bash
cd packages/tools
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Environment Variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:

```env
VITE_FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_api_key
VITE_TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
VITE_SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key
VITE_EXA_API_KEY=your_exa_api_key
VITE_WOLFRAM_APP_ID=your_wolfram_app_id
```

5. Run Storybook to view and test components:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

5. Build the package:

```bash
npm run build
```

6. Run tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Contributing
